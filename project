Step 1 - Create Node JS Express Application.

Step 4 - Create Rest APIs for Employees to perform operations like Add, Edit/Update, Delete, Get Records

    Step 4.1 (POST) - Add Employee records like Emp ID (PK, Auto Increment), Emp First Name, Emp Last Name, Emp Birth Date, Emp Photo, Emp Joining Date, Created Date, Updated Date, Status (Active/Inactive), is_deleted

    Step 4.2 (POST) - Edit Employee based on Emp ID - User cannot update Birth Date, Joining Date

    Step 4.3 (POST) - Get all records based on created date (default filter created date desc)
        - User can filter the records based on Created Date asc, Status (Active/Inactive)
        - User can search record based on Name, Birth Date

    Step 4.4 (GET) - Get employee record based on Emp ID

    Step 4.5 (DELETE) - User can delete the employee record based on emp ID

Note - Record cannot be hard delete only soft delete will be there so might be we need to add extra column for that.

Note - We can add/remove the column fields as per requirement.

Note - Photo need to be saved in folder or else save full photo URL (with timestamp) in the database.

Step 5- Follow Express folder structure like controller, models, routes etc.

Step 6 - All APIs should be listed in POSTMAN tool with request parameters.

Step 7 - All APIs should be secure, need to implement any basic middleware technique or logic. e.g. Any GET API should  not be accessible from browser or from postman directly.

Step 8: we can create sample json file instead of adabase
